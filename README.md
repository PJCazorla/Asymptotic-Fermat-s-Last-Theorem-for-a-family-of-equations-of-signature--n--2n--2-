In this repository, we provide the reader with Magma code to check whether the conditions in Theorem 1 are satisfied. This is contained in the Magma file 'checkingConditions.m'.
The code is self-contained and does not require anything other than a standard Magma distribution.

In addition, the computational results used to prove Theorem 2 are provided in the folder 'Results'.

Please notify any bugs to pedro-jose.cazorlagarcia@manchester.ac.uk
